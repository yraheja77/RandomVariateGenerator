    "**Objective:** Make a 'nice' library of Random Variate Generation routines in Python from a given U(0,1) number. Random Variate Generator (RandVarGen) exposes a number of methods for generating random numbers drawn from a variety of probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "RandVarGen has the following properties:\n",
    "1. Output appears to be i.i.d. Unif(0,1). The probability distributions are derived using NumPy's Legacy Random Generation - [RandomState](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/legacy.html#numpy.random.RandomState \"RandomState\").\n",
    "2. It is fast. The code uses highly-optimized math formula's to minimize resource intensive functions like log(), etc. However, the speed is slower than NumPy's RandomState and [BitGenerator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html \"BitGenerator\") by about 10-25%.\n",
    "3. It has the ability to reproduce any sequence it generates. RandVarGen uses a seed and RandomStates [Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister \"Mersenne Twister\") to generate a 'sequence' of required probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the distribution-specific arguments, each method takes a keyword argument size that defaults to None. If size is None, then a single value is generated and returned. If size is an integer, then a 1-D array filled with generated values is returned."
